## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
This, by default, uses a H100 GPU, which, as of March 22nd, 2025, costs $4 an hour. Modal provides $30 free monthly as of the same date. So, assuming it uses 8 GiB of RAM and 1 CPU core, you should expect a runtime of 7 hours. Please make sure you have enough compute avaliable before running this.

### Requirements:
* `modal` installed and set up.
* A stable internet connection to maintain connection to the container.

### Setting Up


Create this folder structure somewhere:

```
ebook/
â”œâ”€â”€ entrypoint.py
â””â”€â”€ command.sh
```

Copy this into `entrypoint.py`:

```python
import modal

app = modal.App("ebook2audiobook")

@app.function(gpu="H100", timeout=86400) # feel free to change the gpu
def run():
    import time
    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
    import os
    os.chdir("./ebook")
    Popen(["chmod", "+x", "command.sh"])
    time.sleep(5) # give linux enough time to chmod the file
    with Popen(['./command.sh'], stdout=PIPE) as p:
        while True:
            text = p.stdout.read1().decode("utf-8")
            print(text, end='', flush=True)
```

This ensures you can see any output, including the share link needed to access it.

Now, copy this into command.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install git -y
apt-get install sudo curl -y
git clone https://github.com/HydeZero/ebook2audiobook-modal.git
cd ebook2audiobook-modal
chmod +x ebook2audiobook.sh
./ebook2audiobook.sh --share
```

If all goes well, you can exit the directory, run `modal run -m ebook.entrypoint`, and go to the share url that will be displayed.

## Apache Compliance
To comply with Apache, the changes made are:
* Allowed pip install to work in modal via the -r flag
* Removed cache purges from it, as the container will always be fresh and get the version needed.

The original version was made be DrewThomasson, and is avaliable at DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobook. You should be able to access it via the link at the top of the page.
